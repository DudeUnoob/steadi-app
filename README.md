## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL 16
- Redis 7
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)

### Installation

#### Backend

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/steadi/steadi-inventory.git
cd steadi-inventory

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start the backend server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

#### Frontend

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Architecture

Steadi follows a modern cloud-native architecture:

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TanStack Query and Recharts
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLModel ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 for relational data, Redis for caching
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (Lambda, Fargate, RDS, ElastiCache)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Terraform IaC

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the internal API documentation:

- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Development Workflow

Internal development follows these principles:

1. Branch from main (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
2. Commit changes with descriptive messages
3. Submit for code review via pull request
4. Merge after approval and CI checks pass

## MoSCoW Prioritization

Our development follows the MoSCoW prioritization framework:

- **Must Have**: Core inventory functionality (dashboard, repository, threshold engine)
- **Should Have**: Integration capabilities (POS connectors, alerts, PO generation)
- **Could Have**: Workflow enhancements (reorder tracking, analytics)
- **Won't Have** (yet): Advanced features planned for future releases
